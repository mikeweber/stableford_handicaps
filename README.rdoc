= Purpose
Track the stableford scores of golf games, and adjust player handicaps based on
the the best 5 of the most recent 10 rounds. Handicaps will be adjusted when,
using the player's current handicap, their 5 best rounds either average below 34
(handicap will go up), or those rounds average above 36.5 (handicap will go down).
